--------------- HTML5 Validator Plus ------------------------------------------------------
* 2.0   - 2011-06-01 - First release of HTML5 Validator Plus. Various changes and fixes:
** FIX: if the current location changes while a validation is in progress, make sure the results will still end up connected to the validated document
** FIX: strip empty or blank lines from domain whitelist
** FIX: better protection against bad regular expression (e.g., "*.[") in domain whitelist
** NEW: native support for add-on bar, backward compatible with old-style status bar
** NEW: do not auto-validate if add-on bar is collapsed
** NEW: optionally display the validator icon in the browser's location bar
** NEW: detect document-load failures
** NEW: validation results are shared between all tabs and windows displaying the same document
** NEW: the validation-results cache is independent of the browser's page cache
** NEW: (optional) display validation details in a separate window, which keeps a running log of all displayed results during the session
** NEW: empty domain whitelist no longer interpreted as a wildcard for auto-validation; use "*" to enable global auto-validation (not recommended)
** NEW: pending auto-validation can be cancelled by pressing Escape
** NEW: pending auto-validation is automatically cancelled if the current location changes (tab switch, link followed, etc.)
** NEW: preference to allow manual validation of non-whitelisted domains
** NEW: preference to control the maximum size of a document to auto-validate (use -1 to override)
** NEW: preference to control the timeout before auto-validation kicks in
** NEW: preference to select the parser to be used by the validator

** NEW: keyboard shortcut CONTROL+SHIFT+V equivalent to clicking the validator icon
** NEW: don't auto-validate in private-browsing mode

* 2.0.1   - 2011-06-13 - don't validate anything but documents having a text/html document type
* 2.0.2   - 2011-06-25 - suppress "Almost standards mode doctype" error (concerning XHTML 1.0 Transitional doctype) if "Ignore XHTML errors" is in effect
* 2.0.3   - 2012-06-21 - Disable auto-validation unless most recent validator response code is exactly 200. This is done in order not to overload a potentially busy validator.
* 2.0.4   - 2012-08-22 - Fix 'error: Unsupported character encoding name: “charset=utf-8”'. See https://github.com/rogerjohansson/html5validator/issues/7 for details.
* 2.0.5   - 2012-08-23 - Show an "active" icon while a validation is in progress. Optionally suppress 'Using “windows-1252” instead of the declared encoding “iso-8859-1”' warning. Re-enable validation of application/xhtml+xml documents. Disallow auto-validation if the validator is validator.nu.
